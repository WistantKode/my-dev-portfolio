## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally for development and testing, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wistantkode/your-portfolio-repo.git
    cd your-portfolio-repo
    ```
    *(**Important**: Replace `https://github.com/wistantkode/your-portfolio-repo.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install `shadcn/ui` components (if adding new ones or during initial setup):**
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add dropdown-menu # Example: Run this if you need the dropdown-menu component
    # Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>` for any other specific shadcn/ui components used in the project.
    ```

### Running the Project
